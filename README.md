# TDD with Python

A study of obey the testing goat book.

You can see the book [here](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).

## The demo

You can open the demo in the staging server [here](https://staging-tdd-com-python.herokuapp.com/).

## The application

This application was build following the principles of TDD.

### TDD

In the TDD we have to do a lot of disciplined steps.

So, you need to be disciplined to do the TDD in the right way.

Just follow the principles:

- Start writing a test.
- Run the test, write a minimal code, does it pass? No? Repeat!
- Red, Green, Refactor.

Some notes about TDD:

- Don't refactor with failing tests (sometimes you can).
- It's very important to refactor your tests and your production code.
- The tests gives you confidence to change your code.
- Sometimes monkey patch your code is not a good idea. It can couple your code with a implementation.
- Test what happens, not how you do it.
- It's better to test the behavior, not how you do it.
